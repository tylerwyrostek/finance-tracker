            <p class="text-white text-sm">You can plan your income to prepare for the upcoming month. You can add expected income that you will recieve this month and the expense amounts that you want to spend in each category for the month. The expense categories are broken into 3 sections: Needs, Wants, Savings. Using the 50/30/20 model you should aim to have 50% of your expense for the month to cover your needs, 30% to cover you wants, and 20% into savings. You can click the '+' icon to add a new row for expenses.</p>
